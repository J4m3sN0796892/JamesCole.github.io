I decided to write a program which handled internal bookings of IT rooms within the school. (The existing solution was a big shared spreadsheet which could only be accesses by one member of staff at a time so was a rubbish way of handling bookings.) I decided a program which was able to be accessed by multiple members of staff at a time, using logins, to view and reserve rooms at certain times would be much more durable and easier for the user./td>

											The program worked by having a front-end app written in vb.net with a big grid which would show a weeksâ€™ worth of timetabled lessons. The whole grid is colour coded based on information read in from a file (on a per room basis). Each room had a master timetable for the year and bookings were saved separately and only displayed on the correct date if the user changed the date of the grid. Once a room was selected and booked it would be greyed out so other users could not book the same room and there would be no clashes.
