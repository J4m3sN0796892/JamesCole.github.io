									Unlike most of the other programs, this was written as part of an application for a job at Unidays, I was given a set of rules for discounts and i had to write a nice elegant program which would meet a given criteria for certain discounts. Again for this challange i chose to use python because it was the langugae i felt most comfortable with at the time. And personally i find it easier to make small scripts very quickly where as java take a bit more setting up to get to work.

											This program is meant to be a very elegantly programmed program.... if that makes sence, I was trying to show that I can use pythons stupid class system even if it kills me. So even though the actual logic and programming for the discount calculator wasnt very difficult, it should at least look nice from a developers point of view, I hope so anyway. Because of this, im going to put the raw source code and a download below.
