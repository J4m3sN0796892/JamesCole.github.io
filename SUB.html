									<p>Much like Toy town, this was a lockdown project. I was happy with my car, but I do tend to like good quality sound. So, I decided to fix the speakers in my car which (up until this point) were not very good.  This took me a few days to do mostly due to lack of correct parts. I initially started with the intention of changing the stock speakers for some new ones. Once I took the door panels off, I discovered that there were no speakers in the back doors. So, I decided to fit some as well as the front replacement. After this was done, I found the stock stereo was not up to running the new 100-watt speakers. So, I bought and fitted an aftermarket stereo I found on Facebook. Once this was fitted it sounded lots better than the stock system. However, it was lacking some bass. So, I decided to fit some more speakers (I don’t know if you can notice a trend here). I found some bass speakers on Facebook for cheap and an amplifier to run them. Granted I did not look at the picture because I thought they can’t be that big… turns out I lost all boot space from this decision.
                                    </p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>
I decided to build a new floor for my boot so I could reclaim some boot space. So I got some wood, Went to the shed, and turned smooth radio up. I built a frame out of wood and decided to mount the amplifier on the top of the new floor. I then decided I wanted to cool the amp so it wouldn’t run so hot, do I dug out some old PC fans and wired them to the ignition of the car, so when I turn the car on the fans turn on and when I get out the car it doesn’t blow away. Anyway, long story short I have ended up with a 2400-Watt speaker system in my 2009 micra.

											The Main speakers were a routine replacement, the wires were connected to the new speakers and a routine replacement, drill a few new holes, screw them in tight. As for the subwoofer in the boot, I ran some 8gage wire from the battery all the way through the car and into the boot. This needed a fuse fitting so it would not destroy the amp so I wired a fuse under the engine so It wouldn’t ruin the look of the amp. The signal wires were then ran down the opposite side of the car so it didn’t produce interference, a control wire was then added to the ignition of the car so it wouldn’t run when the key wasn’t in the car. Else when I came to drive my car it wouldn’t start because the amp would be drawing power.
